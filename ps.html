<p class="p1">WHY IS</p>
<p class="p2">SPORT</p>
<p class="p3">IMPORTANT?</p>


<p class="p4"> <b> <big> Sports in Body Building </big> </b> <br> <br>
Sports refreshes people’s bodies and minds. It is said that <br> “Health is Wealth.” And a healthy body can give stimulation to people <br>
which takes people forward. Considering the essentials of health <br> in life people have been practicing sports for ages. Sport plays a vital <br>
role in the formation of body muscles. There is no substitute for <br> sports to keep the body healthy and active. A strong body boosts morale <br>
in the battle for life. Also, sports adds power to the mindsets for <br> success.</p>

<p class="p5"><b> <big> Sports in Emotional Development </big> </b> <br> <br>
The need for sports is very important for mental and emotional <br>
development. If children grow up in a playful and cheerful environment <br>
from an early age, their minds will be high. To enhance the freshness <br>
and vitality of the mind sports play a vital role. Therefore, it is seen <br>
that children do not play puppets and keep on with the elderly, and do not <br>
develop emotional health. Rather, they become presumptuous, unstable, and <br>
tempered. So, there is no way to neglect the necessity of sports in healthy <br>
mental and emotional development.</p>


<p class="p6"><b> <big>Sports and Discipline </big> </b> <br> <br>
Discipline not only for just individuals but for the overall development <br>
of the entire country and nation is a major tool. Sports is the lighthouse <br>
of discipline. Regular sports bring discipline to the body and mind. <br>
Collective consciousness emerges in sports. Personal weakness is lost <br>
as a result of a team effort. The whole team jumps in hopes of winning <br>
with all their energy. And this group discipline is one of the cornerstones <br>
of the nation’s overall progress in real.</p>

<p class="p7"><b> <big>Sports and Character</big> </b> <br> <br>
Sport is an eternal source of endless joy. It is through this joy that <br>
the mind and character of the human being arise. This character is the <br>
key to success in the struggle for future life. Training in sports is <br>
a balancing act for people. There is competition for success in the <br>
premises of life like our play, joy of victory and disappointment of <br>
defeat, and instantly the ability to accept it with a calm heart. Sports <br>
give the character of the man with determination, the concentration of <br>
competition, and on the other hand, tolerance of defeat, generosity of heart.</p>


<p class="p8"><b> <big>Sports & Education</big> </b> <br> <br>
Education is not just a promise of passing the test, not even a living <br>
thing, but the ground of mental exercise. At the touch of sports, education <br>
gets perfection, therefore, in the modern education system, sports draws <br>
more attention. If one of the goals of education is to develop a better <br>
life sense, then, the importance of sports is of paramount priority there. <br>
That’s why sports is important in our life for so many reasons what we think <br>
and even not think.</p>


<p class="p9"><b> <big>Sports & Brotherhood</big> </b> <br> <br>
Sport embraces the distant one as its own ignoring the difference. <br>
Through it, one country greets another country. Strengthens the <br>
relationships, expands the field of mutual understanding, and it <br>
is the prime source of brotherhood. In the earnestness of the  <br>
competition, sportsmen win the mind of thousands of sports enthusiasts <br>
with advanced sports tactics in cricket or football or tennis or <br>
badminton whatever. There are sports competitions around the world <br>
where people come closer and that creates a sense of universal <br>
brotherhood.</p>

<p class="p10"><b> <big>Sports in Disease Prevention</big> </b> <br> <br>
Our hearts require a certain amount of daily works. During the game, <br>
hearts pump more blood. Therefore, the heart has the opportunity to <br>
work as needed and stay healthy. Diabetes patients are asked for regular <br>
exercise to control it, as a result, insulin works properly. High blood <br>
pressure, stroke causes problems in the heart. Sport lowers high blood <br>
pressure, Keeps cholesterol level right. Blood circulation in the body is <br>
relatively high during play, so nutrients can go to all parts of the body. <br>
Moreover, white blood cells increase during play that increases the body’s <br>
immunity power. That’s why sports is important in our life.</p>
